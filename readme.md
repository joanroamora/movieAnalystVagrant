# MOVIE ANALYST VAGRANT VERSION

The following is a project in which you will find deployed a runtime environment 
for the movie-analyst application, with local deployment through the Vagrant software. 
The machines will be provisioned from bash scripting, as well as configured the 
necessary networks to link Front, Back and database. 

## 1. THE INSTALLATION ISSUE:

Make sure that you have Vagrant software installed on your operating system. If you 
do not have it you can search for it here: 

**https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads**

It is necessary to have a virtual environment management software. I recommend Virtual Box. 
It is the software that I will use in this development so it is recommended that you use it.

## 2. OPERATING SYSTEM VIRTUAL IMAGE
For this project we will use a 64-bit Linux Trusty image. This image will take some time for the first download from the official Vagrant Boxes source, depending on your bandwidth. However, once 
downloaded you will not have to download it again as long as you keep the Virtual Box image back up.
If you want to know what virtual images you have available locally, please run this command from your preferred console:

*vagrant box list*

If You want to add a new virtual image on your Virtual Box set-up configuration please command:

*vagrant box add imageName*

We recommend you to download images of safe and secured locations.

## 3. CREATE YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE

Set up a configuration file with the command, vagrant init. A series of default directories and files will be displayed, among which you will find the vagrantfile. It is in this file where you should set all the configuration of the infrastructure you want to deploy in your virtual image manager.

If you know Ruby, everything will be easier, if not, don't worry, it's not difficult.

Set the image you want to display in 

*config.vm.box*

Once you choose the image and configure all the features of the instance you are creating locally, you can use the command vagrant up, to launch what is set in the vagrantfile.

Provision with the script.sh that contains this repository, each of the created instances. This configuration is necessary to prepare the machine to support the execution of the development.

## 4. VAGRANTFILE

Please install vagrant disk size before run vagrant up. This is to resize the 
normally disk size prestablished on the Vagrant box, trusty used.

The command is the bellow: vagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize

Then you can find in the vagrant file the configuration for the disk size. 
something like this: 

*config.disksize.size = '5GB'*

## 5. RUN AND DEPLOY DE VMÂ´S

You will not need to start the process with vagrant init, since the vagrant file has been provisioned in this repository. We recommend that you start with a vagrant up. If you only want to start the UI VM, or the API VM, simply type one of the following commands as appropriate:

*vagrant up ui*
*vagrant up api*

Immediately the vagrant software will contact your virtual machine manager, and start creating an instance with the configuration and order that has been set in the vagrantfile. The emulated hardware configuration as well as all the operating system features will be set in this file, which will facilitate the creation of the machines.

## 6. DEPLOY DE APP

When the machines have finished booting and are in the running state, please login to each of the machines if you wish to manually deploy each of the servers. Both the back and front end can be run manually through: 

*nodejs server.js*

However if you wish, you can also add this line of code at the end of each of the scripts, just do that if you want even the server deployment to be automated.

## 7. TEST DE APP

Determine the IP address of the BACK_HOST and through port 3030 point it to the frontend. Navigate through the application and then connect to one of the hyperlinks that will take you to the backend.
